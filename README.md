# etch-a-sketch

This will be a webpage version of an etch-a-sketch that will further develop my javascript knowledge. 

I will need to learn how to make a grid using either flexbox or learning how to use CSS Grid. I will make a scrolling bar to dictate how many squares will be inside the grid. I will need an event listener to turn the squares a different color when mousing over and stay that color. Lastly, there will be a button to reset all the squares to a white color.
